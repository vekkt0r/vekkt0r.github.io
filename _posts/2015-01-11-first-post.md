So, some years after everybody else I have finally come around to
creating a _blog_. My intent is to write about different personal
projects, both hardware and programming related. No thought that this
will be found / read by so many people but more of a experiment to
play around with documenting my projects to gain experience in
techical writing. If somebody manages to find something interesting
then that will be a nice bonus. Probably it will end up abandoned in a
while like most peoples other blogs.

Some short information about myself: IAmA EE working as a consultant
with Embedded Linux kernel and application development. Some of the
areas I enjoy spending my time off on is sensor networks, reverse
engineering, home automation and other small embedded projects.

The blog is setup using GitHub [pages] and [Jekyll] which for me as a
web-design-illiterate was very pleasant to setup and customize. Awesome to
be able to write and publish without leaving Emacs and the
terminal. With the existing themes it even looks acceptable (unlike
something I would have designed :-)).
